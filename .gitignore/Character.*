/ Create an abstract Character class that is composed of the following protected
attributes: “name”, “life”, “agility”, “strength”, “wit”, and a constant “RpgClass” 
string attribute, with the corresponding getters. For languages with 
no constant data member within object, declare the “RpgClass” 
attribute as the others, except
that it should not have any setter.
These attributes must have the following values by default: /

public class Ndoabd0958 {
  public static void main ( String [] args ) {
    Character perso = new TestCharacter ("Andoulaye-Ndong") ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getName () ) ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getRpgClass () ) ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getLife () ) ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getAgility () ) ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getStrength () ) ;
    System . out . println ( perso . getWit () ) ;
    perso . attack ("Rrrrrrrrr .... ") ;
  }
}
